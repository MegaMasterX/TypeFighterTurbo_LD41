Behold
the
chivalric
effigies,
high
upon
the
parapet. 
Stalwart
and
redoubtable,
unwavering
in
their
verisimilitude
to
their
forebears.
They
look
out
across
the
parapet,
to
the
barbicans,
unfurled
standards
undulate
in
the
foretoken
zephyr.
The
sounds
of
carnyx
on
the
selfsame
wind,
a
portent
of
war.
The
legions
of
pugilists
rally
below,
blood
roiled
in
a
vindicates
fervor.
The
rallying
cry
echoes
across
the
battlements,
a
resounding,
tumultuous
roar
that
portends
a
sanguinary
tide.
Deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
ancient
structure,
believed
by
some
to
be
an
antediluvian
remnant,
the
mendicants
mete
out
measured
medicinals,
tallying
their
nostrums
and
panaceas,
and
separating
all
from
the
victuals
and
from
the
surgical
remnants.
Scuttling
to
and
fro
in
blood-stained
tabards,
they
question
the
heavens,
“why
does
our
home
lack
a
storeroom?”
